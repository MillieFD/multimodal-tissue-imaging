# Ocean Direct API Overview

OceanDirect is a multi-platform device driver for Ocean Optics spectrometers, designed specifically for embedded
applications needing to run in resource-constrained hardware environments.

The OceanDirect library is written in C/C++ to provide a lightweight and high-speed solution suitable for real-time 
operation on resource-constrained hardware such as embedded devices. Ocean Insight do not share this `.cpp` source 
code, but instead provide the library as a pre-compiled binary.
Different versions of this precompiled library are available, each targeting a specific hardware architecture (`x86` 
or `arm64`) and operating system (`Linux` or `macOS` or `Windows`). Thus, the library may appear as:

| Filename               | Purpose                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `liboceandirect.so`    | Shared-object for Linux                                                                                                                    |
| `liboceandirect.dylib` | Dynamic library for macOS                                                                                                                  |
| `OceanDirect.dll`      | Dynamically-linked library for Windows                                                                                                     |
| `NETOceanDirect.dll`   | Dynamically-linked library for the dotnet framework 4.7.2 on Windows, which then references `OceanDirect.dll` (both files must be present) | 

> [!ERROR] Not all platforms are maintained
> OceanInsight are currently only actively developing the **Windows x86** version of the Ocean Direct API.
> All other versions may not incorporate the latest features.

The OceanDirect API for your target framework can be accessed from the [Ocean Insight Downloads Page][1]. Each 
downloaded package contains the following directories:

[1]: (https://www.oceanoptics.com/software/oceandirect/)

| Directory  | Contents                                                            |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/doc`     | Supporting documentation such as the README.md                      |
| `/driver`  | Driver (written in C/C++) to handle communication with the device   |
| `/EULA`    | End-User Licensing Agreement (summary below)                        |
| `/include` | Headers  used to build the OceanDirect library.                     |
| `/lib`     | Precompiled library which can be referenced in client applications. |
| `/test`    | Example projects and demos                                          |

In addition to the precompiled binary, OceanInsight also provides header files (.h and .hpp) for all public-facing 
C/C++ methods in the library.
These files show the function signatures, thus enabling users to build their own wrappers if necessary.

### Adding OceanDirectAPI to Python

1. Create a new `OceanDirect` directory in the project's root directory
2. Copy the following files into the `oceandirect` directory:
	- `OceanDirectAPI.py`
	- `od_logger.py`
	- `sdk_properties.py`
	- `__init__.py` is not essential for functionality, but adds convenience.
3. Create a `bin` directory inside the first `oceandirect` directory. You can use a different directory name if required (e.g. `lib`), but make sure to update the `lib_path` variable in `sdk_properties.py`.
4. Copy the library binary (`liboceandirect.so` and/or `liboceandirect.dylib` and/or `OceanDirect.dll`) into the `bin` directory

After following these instructions, the file structure of the project should follow this arrangement.

```
project_root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OceanDirect/
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OceanDirectAPI.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ od_logger.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sdk_properties.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ liboceandirect.so
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ liboceandirect.dylib
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OceanDirect.dll
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Libusb

OceanDirect dynamically binds to `libusb` in order to communicate with USB devices.
You may already have `libusb` installed. If not, follow the instructions below.

**MacOS**

Install libusb using [homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install libusb
```

**Linux**

Install libusb using your package manager:

```bash  
sudo apt updatesudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
```  

**Windows**  

Install libusb using [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/):

```bash 
vcpkg install libusb
```

### Using OceanDirectAPI

1. Add `from OceanDirect import OceanDirectAPI` to the top of your python file
2. Create an instance of the OceanDirectAPI class: `ocean_devices_manager = OceanDirectAPI()`
3. For setup troubleshooting, see [[Ocean Direct API Python Troubleshooting]]

> [!TIP] OceanDirectAPI python class
> The [[OceanDirectAPI Python Class]] manages the connection to the `OceanDirectAPI` C/C++ class in the OceanDirect 
> library (`.so` or `.dylib` or `.dll`) and manages a list of connected devices.

Member functions from the `OceanDirectAPI` class can now be called through the `ocean_devices_manager` object. A 
full list of available functions can be found on the [[OceanDirectAPI Python Class]] page.
These functions are used to find, open, and close connected devices. A new instance of the `spectrometer` python 
class is created for each connected device (irrespective of whether the device is open or closed).

```python
# This is a test Python script.  
from OceanDirect import OceanDirectAPI

if __name__ == '__main__':
	ocean_devs_manager = OceanDirectAPI()
	ids = ocean_devs_manager.get_device_ids()
	device_1 = ocean_devs_manager.open_device(ids[0])
```

> [!INFO] Spectrometer python class
> The OceanDirect Python API also includes a class for an individual spectrometer. The [[Spectrometer Python Class]]
> manages the connection to the `spectrometer` C/C++ class in the precompiled OceanDirect library, and each instance 
> of the `spectrometer` class contains all the information concerning the spectrometer it represents.

In the code example above, `device_1` is an instance of the `spectrometer` class.
A full list of available functions can be found on the [[Spectrometer Python Class]] page.
These functions are used to get and set device parameters, fetch device information, and take measurements.
